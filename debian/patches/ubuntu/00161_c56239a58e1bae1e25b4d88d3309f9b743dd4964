    UBUNTU: SAUCE: (no-up) Input: synaptics - add second variant of two-button clickpad
    
    This is necessary for clickpad detection of Synaptics trackpads in Dell
    Mini 10 series of laptops.
    
    no-up comments: Keep both, so long as they continue to apply cleanly.
    The patches apply only to a couple of old Dell minis, and Dell has said
    they don't intend to use those touchpads again. Upstreaming these
    patches stalled due to lack of information/response, and continuing to
    pursue it probably isn't worth the effort, so they can be marked no-up.
    There's no harm in keeping the patches, but if they become a problem
    they can be dropped.
