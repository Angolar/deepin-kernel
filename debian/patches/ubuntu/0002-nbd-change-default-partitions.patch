    UBUNTU: SAUCE: (no-up) nbd: Change default partitions per device to 15
    
    This was previously changed by using an "options" line in a modprobe.d
    file, however that practice is now deprecated.  This is because module
    names, option names, their values and even their current defaults can
    all change inside the kernel and module-init-tools has never been kept
    in sync.
    
    In addition, changing the kernel means that the option change will apply
    if the module is built in by users or the OEM team.
